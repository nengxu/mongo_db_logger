# MongoDbLogger

Log to MongoDB from a Rails app

## Usage

1. Install the plugin:

        # Rails 3
        rails plugin install git://github.com/customink/mongo_db_logger.git
        # Rails 2
        script/plugin install git://github.com/customink/mongo_db_logger.git

1. Add the following line to your ApplicationController:

        include MongoDBLogging

1. If using Rails < 3, configure specific environments to use the MongoLogger (in config/environments/#{environment}.rb).  Otherwise, the logger is
automatically configured for all environments.

        config.logger = MongoLogger.new

1. Add mongo settings to database.yml for each environment in which you want to use MongoDB for logging. The values below are defaults:

        development:
          adapter: mysql
          database: my_app_development
          user: root
          mongo:
            database: my_app               # required
            capsize: <%= 10.megabytes %>   # default: 250MB for production; 100MB otherwise
            host: localhost                # default: localhost
            port: 27017                    # default: 27017

1. With that in place, a new MongoDB document (record) will be created for each request and,
  by default will record the following information: Runtime, IP Address, Request Time, Controller,
  Action, Params and All messages sent to the logger. The structure of the Mongo document looks something like this:

        {
          'controller'    : controller_name,
          'action'        : action_name,
          'ip'            : ip_address,
          'runtime'       : runtime,
          'request_time'  : time_of_request,
          'params'        : { }
          'messages'      : {
                              'info'  : [ ],
                              'debug' : [ ],
                              'error' : [ ],
                              'warn'  : [ ],
                              'fatal' : [ ]
                            }
        }

1. Beyond that, if you want to add extra information to the base of the document
  (let's say something like user_guid on every request that it's available),
  you can just call the Rails.logger.add_metadata method on your logger like so
  (for example from a before_filter):

        # make sure we're using the MongoLogger in this environment
        if Rails.logger.respond_to?(:add_metadata)
          Rails.logger.add_metadata(:user_guid => @user_guid)
        end

1. And optionally, and PLEASE be sure to protect this behind a login, you can add a basic
logging view by adding the following to your routes:

        map.add_mongo_logger_resources!

  With that you can then visit `/mongo` to view log entries (latest first).  You can add
  parameters like `page=3` to page through to older entries, or `count=30` to change the
  number of log entries per page.

  In Rails 3, there is a simple way to protect the logging view so that it is only accessibly from localhost, convenient for development mode.
  Instead of doing "map.add_mongo_logger_resources!", put this into routes:

        # to view logging info, only accessible locally for security reason
        # TODO need to create customized controller behind Admin login
        resources :logging,
          :controller => "MongoDBLogging/Mongo",
          :only => [:show, :index, :destroy],
          :constraints => {:remote_ip => /127.0.0.1/}

  
## Examples

And now, for a couple quick examples on getting ahold of this log dataâ€¦
First, here's how to get a handle on the MongoDB from within a Rails console:

    >> db = MongoLogger.mongo_connection
    => #<Mongo::DB:0x102f19ac0 @slave_ok=nil, @name="my_app" ... >

    >> collection = db[MongoLogger.mongo_collection_name]
    => #<Mongo::Collection:0x1031b3ee8 @name="development_log" ... >

Once you've got the collection, you can find all requests for a specific user (with guid):

    >> cursor = collection.find(:user_guid => '12355')
    => #<Mongo::Cursor:0x1031a3e30 ... >
    >> cursor.count
    => 5

Find all requests that took more that one second to complete:

    >> collection.find({:runtime => {'$gt' => 1000}}).count
    => 3

Find all order#show requests with a particular order id (id=order_id):

    >> collection.find({"controller" => "order", "action"=> "show", "params.id" => order_id})

Find all requests with an exception that contains "RoutingError" in the message or stack trace:

    >> collection.find({"messages.error" => /RoutingError/})
